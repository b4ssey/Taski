## Reflection

* I needed to get my hands dirty with backend development. I also needed to know how to develop and deploy 3-tier application architectures

* One of the security flaws taken advantage of by hackers are aunthentication flaws, developing this niche application gives me a better understanding of how various threat actors try to maliciously bypass a developers flow

* Again, I had issues with giving my client app access to my Gmail credentials and had to learn about Auth2 and how it works. 

* I will need to also work on its redux architecture to make it more seamless for users.
